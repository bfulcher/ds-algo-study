Problem:
 - You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.
 - Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

Solution:
This is really simple to do in Python. First you convert the given number to a string, and then replace the first instance of '6' with '9'
using the replace() function. After doing that, return the result cast back as an integer.
