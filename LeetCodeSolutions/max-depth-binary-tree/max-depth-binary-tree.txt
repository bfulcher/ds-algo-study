Prompt:
  *  Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
  *  A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
  
We can solve this a few different ways, I will include 3 solutions.

Recursive DFS Notes:
  *  Recursion always bends my brain a bit, however this is a pretty simple example to show recursive depth first search
  *  The way this works is by setting an if statement to catch the "base" case (in ours it is an empty tree) and then returning
     1 + the max between the solution for both sides of the tree.
