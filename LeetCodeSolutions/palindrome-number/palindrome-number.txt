Prompt:
  *  Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
  *  An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
       -  For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
       
Notes:
  *  I solved this twice, first using Python string manipulation (which I am much more familiar/comfortable with) and then again using
     bit manipulation (the "correct" way to solve it)
       -  Not sure if LeetCode's run-times are accurate, however I found that string-manip was reasonably faster than bit-manip.
  *  Doing this with string is really simple in Python.
